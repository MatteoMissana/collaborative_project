## Project Files

### 1. Main Code for Voice Commands
The primary script for handling voice commands is `main.py`. This file contains the logic for processing and executing voice commands.

To run it, execute:
```bash
python main.py
```

### 2. Evaluation of Accuracy and Confusion Matrices
To evaluate the accuracy of the voice commands and generate confusion matrices, use `valutazione_accuracy.py`.

Run it as follows:
```bash
python valutazione_accuracy.py
```

### 3. Arduino Code
The code for the Arduino component is located in the `./arduino_robarm/` subfolder. You can upload the relevant sketch to your Arduino device using the Arduino IDE or any compatible tool.
